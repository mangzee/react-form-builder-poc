# React Form Builder & Form Filler (POC)

This repository demonstrates a simple proof-of-concept for building and filling forms with React (a dynamic form builder). It uses **Create React App**, **React Router**, and **dnd-kit** (for drag-and-drop) to illustrate basic functionality. Below is an overview of how it works, along with instructions on running it locally.

## Features

1. **Form Builder** (`src/routes/FormBuilder.jsx`)  
   - Add various types of questions (text, multiple choice, file upload, etc.).  
   - Reorder questions using drag-and-drop.  
   - Edit question labels, options, and remove questions.  
   - Simulate saving the form schema to a backend.

2. **Form Filler** (`src/routes/FormFill.jsx`)  
   - View the form schema and enter answers for each question type.  
   - Upload files (this is mocked for demonstration—no real backend).  
   - Simulate submission of answers to a backend.

3. **Routing** (`src/App.js`)  
   - Basic **React Router** setup to handle `/build` for form creation and `/forms/:id` for form filling.

## Technology Stack

- **React** (bootstrapped with Create React App)  
- **React Router** (client-side routing)  
- **dnd-kit** (drag-and-drop functionality)  
- **uuid** (unique IDs for form fields)  
- **Web Vitals** (metrics, optional)  
- **Jest & React Testing Library** (testing, optional)

## Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
2. **Run in Development Mode**  
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

3. **Build for Production**  
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```
   - Generates optimized files in the `build/` folder.

## Notes & Disclaimer

- **POC Only**: This project is a minimal proof-of-concept. It is not production-ready.  
- **File Uploads**: In `FormFill.jsx`, the file upload flow is a mock function that simulates uploading. Replace with actual backend logic for real use.  
- **Security**: Implement proper authentication, authorization, and form data validation in a real environment.  
- **Generated by Repomix**: This repository’s files may be merged by [Repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix). If editing, make changes in the actual source files rather than in the merged representation.
